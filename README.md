# Bank Holidays in England (UK) during 2018/19 using `.fetch()`

I used JSON data provided by gov.uk [here](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json) using the new `.fetch()` API in vanilla JS to parse over the holidays, and only display the ones in 2018 / 19.

You can find a working version over at https://codepen.io/mushroom23/full/NOxBOM/

## Next Steps

- Use `Date.now()` to get the latest time, and only display bank holidays in the future. 
- Display a countdown to the next bank holiday
